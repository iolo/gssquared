# XRGB

The Apple III and, I believe, the Apple II with the Apple II RGB card, supported the AppleColor Monitor 100, which was an XRGB card.

XRGB is a digtal interface with 4 bits, providing high quality 16 color.

The 4 bits are decoded to a 16 color palette by the monitor.

This is the monitor:

What's not clear is the Apple III video memory map.
