# GSSquared - Ultimate Apple II Series Emulator

The ambition for this project is large - and it will take a while to get it done. So at any given point in time, consider it a work-in-progress complete with bugs, missing features, and experiments. Of course there will be plenty that "just works".

# Project Status (as of 2025-04-07)

# More Detailed Notes on Status

## Keyboard

### Apple II+

1. control keys: YES
1. shift keys: YES
1. arrow keys: YES. II+ only has left and right arrow keys.
1. Escape key: YES
1. RESET key: YES. Map Control+F10 to this.
1. EXIT key: YES. Map F12 to this.
1. REPT key: no. But we don't need this, autorepeat is working. Ignore this.
1. Backspace - YES. This apparently maps to same as back arrow. Got lucky.

## ROMs

For now, ROMs are included in the source tree and distribution.

Info on the character set:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_character_set


## Display

The display is managed by the cross-platform SDL3 library, which supports graphics
but also sound, user input, lots of other stuff. It is a library intended for
video games, and in thinking about all the things that make up a good emulator, 
emulators fit the video game category quite closely.


### Text Mode

Text mode is complete. It supports 40-column normal, inverse, and flash.

### Low-Resolution Graphics

Low-resolution graphics are complete. They work with screen 1, 2, split-screen, and full-screen.

### High-Resolution Graphics

Monochrome (green screen) high-resolution graphics are complete.


## Keyboard

Status of keyboard:

1. control keys: YES
1. shift keys: YES
1. arrow keys: YES. II+ only has left and right arrow keys.
1. Escape key: YES
1. RESET key: YES. Map Control+F10 to this.
1. EXIT key: YES. Map F12 to this.
1. REPT key: no. But we don't need this, autorepeat is working. Ignore this.
1. Backspace - YES. This apparently maps to same as back arrow. Got lucky.


## Disk Drive Interfaces

### Disk II Controller Card Design and Operation

https://www.bigmessowires.com/2021/11/12/the-amazing-disk-ii-controller-card/

This is highly timing-dependent, and, the way to go I think is to simulate time passage by
counting cycles, not by counting realtime. This way floppy disks can be simulated at any speed.
If we're at free-run, then the floppy disk would operate at that speed, and we don't have to
slow down the clock.

This is required for DOS 3.3 compatibility.


### RAMfast SCSI Interface

I'm not sure if there is any benefit to emulating the RAMfast SCSI interface. An Apple II forum
user suggested it, but, I don't think there was any software that required it specifically?
(There was also a suggestion to emulate a SecondSight, and, that would be way easier and
make more sense).

### Pascal Storage Device

There is a standardized device interface that ProDOS supports, called Pascal. This may be what
became known as the SmartPort / ProDOS block-device interface. See above.


## Code Organization

### Platforms

When a virtual Apple II is created and 'powered on', there are several stages.

1. Platform is initialized.
1. CPU structure is created.
1. Memory allocated and initial memory map assigned.
1. Devices are initialized and 'registered'.
1. The CPU is 'powered on'.

A "Platform" is a specific selection and combination of: CPU type, devices, and memory map.
Because so much of the Apple II series share significant systems and subsystems,
we define and implement those with granularity and "compose" them together when a 
particular virtual machine is set up.

As one example, the Apple II, II+, IIe, IIc, and IIgs all share the same $C030 primitive
speaker toggle. So, we do that only once. When we 'boot' a IIgs OR a IIe, we call
"init_mb_speaker" against the CPU structure, and that hooks in this functionality.

Similarly with CPUs. You want a IIe with nmos 6502? Great. Select those components.
You want a IIe with original firmware but cmos 6502? You can define a platform
to do exactly that.

Want to create your own platform that never existed in reality and experiment?
Go for it! Design the next generation of Apple II! Then maybe someone can take your
idea and implement in hardware.

Contribute new devices back to the project for fun and profit! Well, for fun anyway.

### CPU

### Bus

The Bus is the concept that ties the CPU together with memory and devices.
Apple II devices of course are memory-mapped I/O, i.e., their control registers
are accessed at specific memory addresses.
